# An Object-Oriented Approach to the Planarity Algorithm
The first algorithm for testing planarity of graphs in linear-time was published by John Hopcroft
and Bob Tarjan in 1974. This algorithm, among other contributions to the fields of
algorithms and data structures, led them to receive the ACM Turing Award in 1986.

Later, in 1988, David Gries and Jinyun Xue wrote CS Tehcnical Report 88-906. In
their revised presentation of the algorithm, they presented an implementation in Pascal.
Java did not exist at the time.

The goal of this project is to implement the Hopcroft-Tarjan algorithm based on
the Gries and Xue presentation, using Object-Oriented Programming in Java. Special thanks
to Professor Gries for suggesting this exercise.
